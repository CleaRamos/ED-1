	<p> In this project, we learned about soldering and circuits in order to create a synthesizer using a speaker, potentiometers, and more electrical components. Then we designed an acrylic enclosure for the synthesizer with 3D printed knobs.

	<p> Then, I constructed my breadboard by inserting the chip, the potentiometers, the switch, resistors and the capacitors along with wires that would complete the circuit. The last items I connected were the speaker, battery clip and the battery. I used written instructions, pictures, and the schematic to help me place the components and the wires in the correct place.</p>

	<div style = "background-color: #ffdb4d" >
		<h4 id = "1.4"> 4. Challenges and Setbacks </h4>
	</div>
	<p>This project introduced many new concepts and skills such as soldering and composing a breadboard which printed some challenges and difficulties. For example, when soldering wires to the switch, I initially had a cold solder because I did not get the components hot enough for the iron solder to attach well. After a few attempts of reheating the switch, I was able to successfully add more solder to form a solid joint between the wire and the switch.
	</p>
	
	<p>
Another difficulty I encountered was when I assembling and testing my breadboard. This was the first time I completed a circuit on a breadboard, so I was a little confused when following the instructions on how and where to place certain wires and components. When I finished my breadboard and adjusted the potentiometers, the speaker did not make sound. So, I tested components like my chip, and I compared my breadboard to the example breadboard that Ms. Riley had made. This method of checking helped me to identify incorrect placements of some wires. Once I found my errors, I turned on the switch and the potentiometers of the circuit, and the speaker finally produced sounds.

	<p> At first, I found it challenging to correctly place some of the electrical components onto the perfboard because it was difficult to see which pin each wire was in. So, I had to be very careful when placing my electrical components in the correct holes. I frequently referenced my pictures of my breadboard to confirm the correct placement of the components. Additionally, it was difficult to solder the components in the small holes of the perfboard. I had to be very careful and make sure that the solder in one hole did not overflow into another hole because that might disrupt the flow of energy.  </p>

<! -- 3.1 OVERVIEW & GUIDLEINES ------------------------------------------------------>


	<div style = "background-color: #ffdb4d" >
		<h4 id = "3.1"> 1. Overview & Guidelines </h4>
	</div>

	
	<p> After completing the soldering component of the synthesizer, we designed an enclosure to house the electrical components. The enclosure, made from wood and acrylic panels, must have raster/sketch elements as well as holes for the potentiometers, switch and openings for the sound of the speaker. We also designed 3D printed,press-fit knobs for the potentiometers.</p>



<! -- 3.2 DESIGNING ENCLOSURE PANELS ------------------------------------------------------>


	<div style = "background-color: #ffdb4d" >
		<h4 id = "3.2"> 2. Designing Enclosure Panels </h4>
	</div>

	
	<p> When choosing a design for my enclosure, I wanted transparent panels and a minimal design so that the wiring and electrical components of the synthesizer were visible. So, after brainstorming different designs and color options, I choose a 90's, geometric pattern paired with transparent iridescent acrylic for the side panels and a clear acrylic for the top panel. I sketched designs for each of the 4 side panels and the top panel while keeping in mind the placement of holes for the different components of the synthesizer.  </p>

	<tr>
		<td> <img src = "DesignBrainstorm.jpeg" alt = "DesignBrainstrorm" style = "width: 500px; height:375px">  </td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th> Design Brainstorm </th>
		<th> Design layout on side and top panels</th>
	</tr>
	</table>

	<p> Then, I used my sketches as a reference and replicated the design with vectorized shapes and lines in an Adobe Illustrator file. I experimented with different raster settings as I wanted different shades to differentiate solid shapes and outlines. So, I filled some shapes with a gray color which produced a lighter raster, and other shapes were filled with black, which produced a darker raster. I also included circular holes for the potentiometers and switch. I arranged the speaker holes in a triangle so that it would match the geometric 90's pattern. </p>

<! -- 3.3 DESIGNING and PRINTING 3D KNOB TOPPERS ------------------------------------->


	<div style = "background-color: #ffdb4d" >
		<h4 id = "3.3"> 3. Designing and Printing 3D Knob Toppers </h4>
	</div>
	<p> Before designing my knob toppers, I measured the heights and widths of the 5K and 1M potentiometers so that I could create a precisely fitting topper.  <p>
	<table>
	<tr>
		<td> <img src = "PotMeasurements5K.jpeg" alt = "PotentiometerMeasurmenets5K" style = "width: 375px; height: 250px"></td>
		<td> <img src = "PotMeasurements1M.jpeg" alt = "PotentiometerMeasurmenets1M" style = "width: 375px; height: 250px"></td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th> Measurements of the 5K potentiometer</th>
		<th> Measurements of 1M potentiometers</th>
	</tr>
	<table>
	
	<p> When designing my knobs, I wanted their shape to match the geometric pattern that I created for the enclosure panels. So, I took the intersecting circles and triangles of my design and created intersecting spheres and pyramids for my toppers. I created 2 different topper designs, one for the 5K potentiometer and one for the 1M potentiometer since they were different sizes. For the 1M potentiometer, I created a 1-inch diameter sphere with an extruded ring and triangle. For the 5K potentiometer, I created a pyramid with a triangular base and added a sphere and an extruded ring. Then, I used my measurements to create a press fit hole with crush ribs at the bottom of the knobs. </p>

	<table>
	<tr>
		<td> <img src = "FrontView1M.png" alt = "Front1m" style = "width: 280px; height: 260px"></td>
		<td> <img src = "BottomView1M.png" alt = "Bottom1m" style = "width:280px; height: 260px"></td>

	</tr>
	<tr>

		<th> Bottom View of 1M Potentiometer </th>
		<th> Front View of 5K Potentiometer </th>
		<th> Bottom View of 5K Potentiometer </th>
	</tr>

	</table>

	<p> I chose to print my toppers in the clear and white filaments to match the frosted white look of the rastered shapes on my panels. When preparing the GCODE file, I had to position my toppers upside-down, and I had to add support to the shapes.  After my knobs were printed, I fitted them onto the potentiometers. Both of them had a loose fit, so I adjusted my knobs by scaling them down to 97% on <i> Ulitmaker Cura </i>. </p>

<! -- 3.4 ASSEMBLING the Enclosure ---------------------------------------------------->


	<div style = "background-color: #ffdb4d" >
		<h4 id = "3.4"> 4. Assembling the Synth Enclosure </h4>
	</div>

	<p> Before assembling my enclosure, I had to insulate my perfboard with hot glue to make sure that the wiring and electrical components were secure. To assemble my enclosure, I pieced together the precut wooden base and cut 4 wooden dowels for the corners of the box. I placed the synthesizer perfboard and the battery into the precut slots of the base. Then, I placed the potentiometers, the switch, and the speaker into/next to their corresponding holes in the top and side acrylic panels. I secured the potentiometers with washers and nuts. Then I placed the panels onto the wooden base. Finally, I placed the knob toppers onto the potentiometers.  </p>

<! -- 3.5 CHALLENGES AND Setbacks ------------------------------------------------->


	<div style = "background-color: #ffdb4d" >
		<h4 id = "3.5"> 5. Challenges and Setbacks </h4>
	</div>

	<p> Most of the challenges I encountered during Part III of the Synthesizer project was when I was assembling the enclosure. For instance, when I tried to place the acrylic panels into the wooden base, the panels were too large for the precut slots, so I had to sand the base and the corner pieces. Also, when I was placing the switch into its specific hole in one of my panels, it did not fit. I realized that I did not measure the switch at its widest point. I made the hole too small since I did not account for the switch's perturding tabs. So, I also had to sand the hole for the switch to fit through. And in order to put the switch through the hole, I had to unsolder it, put it through the hole, and then resolder it to the rest of the synthesizer. But, I did not resolder the switch correctly, and I forgot to insulate it. So, for a short period of time, my circuit did not work, and I had to troubleshoot and carefully examine my work to fix my circuit. </p>
